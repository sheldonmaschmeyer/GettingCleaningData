# Coursera Getting and Cleaning Data Project
Student: Sheldon Maschmeyer

The run_analysis.R script is used to download data collected from a Samsung Galaxy S accelerometer and merge the data into a single dataset to be used for further analysis. 
This single dataset preserves: 
* the unique identifier representing the subjects studied 
* descriptive activity and variable names 
* retains only the mean and standard deviation for each variable

The CodeBook.md contains a description of the new tidydata.txt data set file. 
instructions.pdf contains the original assignment instructions
