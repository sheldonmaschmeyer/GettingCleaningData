# Coursera Getting and Cleaning Data Project
Student: Sheldon Maschmeyer

The run_analysis.R script is used to download data collected from a Samsung Galaxy S accelerometer and merge the data into a single dataset (tidyData.txt), to be used for further analysis. 

This single dataset:
* Merges the test and training data into a single table
* Preserves the unique identifier representing the subjects studied 
* Has descriptive activity and variable names 
* Retains only the mean and standard deviation for each variable

The CodeBook.md contains a description of the new tidydata.txt data set file. 
instructions.pdf contains the original assignment instructions
