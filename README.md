# Coursera Getting and Cleaning Data Project
Student: Sheldon Maschmeyer
The run_analysis.R script is used to download data collected from a Samsung Galaxy S accelerometer and merge the data into a single dataset to be used for further analysis. 
This single dataset preserves the subjects studied, descriptive activity and variable names and retains only the mean and standard deviation for each variable. 
The CODEBOOK contains a description of the new tidydata.txt data set file. 
instructions.pdf contains the original assignment instructions
